## Introduction

This lesson was heavily based on existing lessons from Carpentries Incubators; namely:

 1. [Introduction to Working with MRI Data in Python](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-IntroMRI/)
 2. [Introduction to dMRI](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-dMRI/)
 3. [Functional Neuroimaging Analysis in Python ](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/SDC-BIDS-fMRI/)

Until clarification over overlapping materials with all authors of these repositories has been discussed. This lesson is temporarily offline.
